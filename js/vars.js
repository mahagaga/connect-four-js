// Create variables for use in our game.

// Config object.
// @todo: Store row & column count in config and have the game adjust
//        automatically. Keep the board below in a comment for reference. See
//        http://stackoverflow.com/a/2716973/1154642 for how to build the table
//        automatically with loops. Maybe expose the option to users... but
//        probably not, to keep the UI simple.
// @todo: Eliminate global variables and methods by making them all part of a
//        private anonymous function. For Reference: Anonymous Functions And The
//        Module Pattern (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/20/seven-javascript-things-i-wish-i-knew-much-earlier-in-my-career/).
// @todo: Extra credit. Make this more accessible (keyboard navigation + screen-
//        reader friendly).
